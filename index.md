## Ideas List for Google Summer of Code from the Mayor's Office of New Urban Mechanics

###  Urban Tree Canopy Detection Using Satellite and Aerial Imagery

The City of Boston's Parks Department maintains a comprehensive data set on trees in Boston. However, it's a manual and laborious process to get the data (such as  conducting site visits for tree counts) on a regular basis. We would like to explore the use of satellite and aerial imagery to get a regularly updated  census of trees across the city. We would also like to look at the feasibility of determining tree health and the variety of tree species across the city.

The ideal outcome would be the creation of a new, accurate machine learning model focused on urban trees canopies, the creation of a simple web interface for the Parks Department to upload new aerial imagery for analysis, and the ability to the Parks Department to generate a list of statistics on tree counts to ensure that it continues to plants trees in an equitable manner across the city.

We would give this project a **medium** level of difficulty.

This project will require intermediate experience with Python, machine learning (in particular TensorFlow and training models with imagery), and limited experience with JavaScript HTML and CSS.

The core code base for the project is [Deep Forest](https://github.com/weecology/DeepForest), a machine learning library for tree crown detection. We will be partnering with the the WeEcology group at the University of Florida, in particular Ben Weinstein Ph.D. who has agreed to serve as an advisor. The mentors for the project will include two Program Directors at the Mayor's Office of Urban Mechanics, including one who served as a Google Summer of Code mentor at Code for America in 2011.
